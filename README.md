## Reflection

This was a 2 days long project built during my aaa hiring challenge. Project goals included building simple responsive frontend with React, MaterialUI, Typescript and React Router for displaying the data provided by API https://public.allaboutapps.at/hiring/clubs.json .

In this project I was using React functional components and React hooks. Due to the project size I preffered using component states instead of Redux store. 
One of the main challenges I ran into was working for the first time with MaterialUI. It is a large framework which requires some amount of expertise in order to use it efficiently. In the end of the day, beacuse of well written documentation I realized whole potential of the framework, so I will defenetly integrate it in the upcoming projects. Another challenging moment was to use fuctional components, because my previos react projects I was implementing with the help of class components. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
